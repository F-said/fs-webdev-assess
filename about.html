                        Inspired by the Pokemon trading card game, this page displays the entire list of generation 1 pokemon and their respective
                        sprites. Select any pokemon to view their stats, image, and description as translated from the original Japanese Blue version.

                         This feature was made by through two JavaScript functions, one that expresses a CSV file of pokemon data as Bootstrap cards,
                         and another that rewrites a div each time a pokemon card is selected.

                        Inspired by the Gameboy Advanced Pokemon games, this feature allows you to choose two pokemon and have them battle in 
                        non-interactive step-by-step battle that ends until one pokemon faints.

                <p>
                    My first exposure to software bugs came long before I was introduced to the words "bit", "algorithm", or "compression." When I was 
                    9, I played a game called "Pokemon Fire Red." In the 1996 predecessor of this game,
                    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue">Pokemon Red</a>", was an
                    enigmatic software bug called "<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/MissingNo.">Missingno</a>." It looked like a random assortment of pixels, but it 
                    still had a mystical air about it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, this bug would only occur if the player executed a set of steps in order. There were also rumors that this 
                    bug would duplicate an exceedingly rare item in your inventory after you encounter it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So essentially, you have a reward-bearing metaphysical being that appears in your game after a ritual is followed. This was the 
                    equivalent of Moses encountering the burning bush and probably imprinted ideas of technology and metaphysics in many young minds around this time. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When you begin to peel back the layers however, you have interesting case-study on the unintentional effects of software, 
                    and how they can propagate throughout a system to cause suprising postconditions. The details of this are summarized in this
